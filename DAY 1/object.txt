Objects are important data types in javascript. 
Objects are different than primitive datatypes. 
The primitive datatypes are number, string, boolean, etc.
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key value pair. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods of object.
The object is called non-primitive datatype or copy by reference.

Syntax for object:
	Variable object name = {
 	 key : value pairs
};

Example for object
const person = {
  name : "Priyanka",
  age  : 30,
  email: "Priyanka@gmail.com"
};


Internal Representation of Objects:
	Internally, object stores objectâ€™s properties and their corresponding values. 
	This allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.
{
	 name : "Priyanka",
 	 age  : 30,
  	 email: "Priyanka@gmail.com"
}
